# Possible Issues

- Motion Smoothing: EntryPointNotFoundException

- Check other mods that optionally depends on SRT.

- Some features of SRT not working properly - currently i only focus on multi-saveslot save/load, and i'm not familiar with some other speedrun part of SRT. So tell me if you find some issues!

- Some render may not work properly - I've met these kinds of bugs but can't reproduce.

If you have any feedback, ping/DM me @Lozen0956#0 in discord, or open an issue/PR in github.
